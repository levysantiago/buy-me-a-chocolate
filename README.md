# Buy Me a Chocolate

The Buy Me a Chocolate is a "remake" of [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/?source=fba1&utm_source=FriendlyGAd&utm_medium=BmcAdSearch&utm_campaign=April2020&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr82iBhCuARIsAO0EAZz4NJR2xyfEwbQ4hJmWc2QTfMAiyNBWN63AUomUEzKNEpS252zyYZoaAjlDEALw_wcB) buy in blockchain. In this application you can buy someone a chocolate with BNB, and this person will receive CHOC tokens. After the receiver can access the Buy Me a Chocolate platform to redeem the BNB.

But, here is the thing. Each time someone buys a token, part of the CHOC fee involved is burned. That means that the CHOC price increases. So if you hold your CHOC token for a long time, you might receive more than it was worth when you received the tokens. In the other hand, when someone redeem the tokens, these tokens are burned and the person receives the BNB amount. This means that the CHOC price decreases.

To start using the platform you must have the [Metamask wallet extension](https://metamask.io/) installed to your browser.

## CHOC Token

The CHOC token is an BEP20 (or ERC20) token deployed, for now, to BSC (Binance Smart Chain) testnet network.

Here is CHOC token address if you want to add to your wallet: [0x87E42aD1325aD96797b914Ccb1e5Af8a2C72Ee0e](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x87E42aD1325aD96797b914Ccb1e5Af8a2C72Ee0e).
